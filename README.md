# ForwardCharm

This repository served two functions: i) it collects the different predictions charm hadron production at the LHC, and ii) it contains a script that plots these preictions. 

The goal is to produce a figure like the one below, but with more predictions from more groups. We aim to do this before the FPF5 meeting on November 15/16 2022.
