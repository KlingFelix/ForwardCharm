# ForwardCharm

This repository served two functions: 
- i) it collects the different predictions charm hadron production at the LHC, and
- ii) it contains a script that plots these predictions (see example below).

Currently, we have the following predictions:

** MC Generators: Hadronic Interaction Models ** 
 - SIBYLL 2.3d (relevant reference [1806.04140](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04140) )
